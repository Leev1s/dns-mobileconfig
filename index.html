    <p><b>If the tool does not work, please clear your cache and/or reload the webpages!</b> I am continuously updating
        this tool, but the changes might not load in your browser unless you clear your cache.</p>

    <h3>What is this?</h3>
    <p>This website allows you to create configuration profiles for your Apple device to use the new built-in encrypted
        DNS options.</p>
    <h3>Details</h3>
    <p>Apple has included built-in support for DNS-over-HTTPS and DNS-over-TLS in their iOS 14 and macOS Big Sur
        updates. But there is no possibility to use this new feature without a third-party app or configuration
        profiles. I personally preferred not to install some app to manage this for me. <br>
        This websites generates a configuration profile which is installable on your system and activates encrypted DNS.
    </p>
    <h4>Why not use an app?</h4>
    <p>I prefer to use tools which I can make sure do exactly what they claim to do. Configuration profiles are rather
        transparent, they can be opened with any text editor and viewed. This website is completely open-source. <br>
        An app off the App Store might do what it should, sure. But it also might capture data inbetween and negate the
        privacy advantage that DoH and DoT bring.</p>
    <h3>How do I use this?</h3>
    <p>Visit this website using your Apple device and navigate to the tool. Then, upload a pre-made configuration or
        enter your own settings and click/tap "Add to profile". When you're done adding configurations, open the
        "Finalize" page to download the finished file. Then, open the downloaded file using the "Files" app.
        <br>
        Your device will ask you a few times, be sure to accept the warnings.<br>
        <b>The generated profiles are not signed. This is normal.</b>
    </p>
    <h3>Why should I care about encrypted DNS?</h3>
    <p>DNS is basically the phone book of the internet. If you visit a website, your computer first contacts the DNS
        server to look up where its even supposed to connect to.<br>
        While the traffic itself is often encrypted nowadays, the lookup itself still is not without DoH/DoT. So anyone
        in the same network will still know exactly which websites you visited.<br>
        If you want to know more about this, give <a href="https://paulmillr.com/posts/encrypted-dns/">this blog post by
            Paul Miller</a> a read, he explains the subject very nicely.</p>
    <h3>DNS-over-HTTPS or DNS-over-TLS?</h3>
    <p>There isn't a huge difference between the two protocols.<br>
        DoH is harder to spot in regular network traffic and is also less likely to be blocked in a corporate
        environment, since it uses the same port as any secured website.<br>
        DoT is possibly faster, since it uses one layer of transport less. But it uses it's own port and is therefore
        obvious to any other people monitoring the network - and might be blocked behind very strict firewalls.</p>
    <p>In the end, it's more personal preference than anything else. If your system supports both - as Apple systems do
        - you can choose whatever you want.</p>
    <h3>Which provider should I choose?</h3>
    <p>This comes down to a few factors. First, location. Living in countries which block certain websites narrows your
        choice down considerably. Furthermore, different providers have different priorities. I suggest you do some
        research into the providers yourself. For example, you could take a look at <a
            href="https://privacyguides.org/providers/dns/">this table</a> which lists a few providers and compares
        them.</p>
    <h3>Support</h3>
